## Installation

Install `sw` command:

```zsh
brew tap mokuo/starwars-terminal
brew install starwars-terminal
```

Get a compatible terminal emulator:

- [iTerm2 \- macOS Terminal Replacement](https://iterm2.com/)

If requested, I would like to support more terminal emulators!

## Usage

```zsh
# Change the background image to a Star Wars character (random).
sw

# You can specify the character name.
# ex) R2-D2
sw r2-d2

# List character names.
sw list
```

## Trouble shooting

### iTerm2

Please make sure you can run a script of iTerm2 Python API:
